vimclutch hardware

## Description
This is a VIM clutch which uses the Arduino ProMicro and a few tactile switches.  The top two tactile switches are for switching modes.  There are LEDs to show which state the board is in.  There is a solder-on connection for the foot pedal.

## BOM
TODO

## Tools
* KiCAD 6.0
* Fusion 360

## Next Steps
Consider the possibility of using a microcontroller with a USB-C port instead.

Update to KiCAD 7.0

## Project Expectations
This project is provided as a form of public entity.  The designs provided are not guaranteed for mercantability or quality beyond the occasional one-off production from enthusiasts.

The tolerances from the SLA files and f360 should be sized for reasonably accurate FDM 3d printers and nothing more.  Do not expect them to be right for MSLA, injection molding, or subtractive manufacturing.

### Expected Support for the Project
Feel free to start a conversation in the Issues on GitHub or on any other social media sites.

The author may be willing to adjust some tolerances if the files are not editable enough for potential users.

## Contributing
Please leave feedback in the Issues tab on the ease of assembly and similar items.  Minor updates on "I had to file this part in this way" could potentially improve the assembly for other people.
